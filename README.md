## Description

This, as you can see, is a website for my Web Development portfolio! My very own website about myself where I talk about myself! As you can see, this site contains two pages: Portfolio and About Me. The Portfolio page consists of multiple photos. The About Me page has a photo of me along with two paragraphs about me. The first paragraph talks about my previous employment and my journey into finding my way to Web Development. The second paragraph is a short one about my hobbies and interests and my fur babies.

For each of the pages, we start off with the Navbar, which holds my name and the link to the two pages. My name is clickable, and if clicked, it will send you to the About Me page. This site was made with React and React Routers.

## Features

As you make the window smaller and smaller, you will notice that the pages follow along and adjust to the shrinking. On the Portfolio page, once it's been shrunk down a phone layout, you'll see that the photos stack below each other, showing only one photo per row. In the About me page, you'll see that the paragraph stacks below the photo as well. This was created using Bootstrap coding, so there is a link to the Bootstrap CCS style sheet as well as Bootstrap Javascript, which was needed for the navbar dropdown system.
